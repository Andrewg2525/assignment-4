        <h2 id="jokes">Do You Want to Buy This Dog?</h2>
        <p>
            A guy spots a sign outside a house that reads “Talking Dog for Sale.” Intrigued, he walks in.

            “So what have you done with your life?” he asks the dog.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I’ve led a very full life,” says the dog. “I lived in the Alps rescuing avalanche victims. Then I served my country in Iraq. And now I spend my days reading to the residents of a retirement home.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The guy is flabbergasted. He asks the dog’s owner, “Why on earth would you want to get rid of an incredible dog like that?”

        </p>
        <p>
        The owner says, “Because he’s a liar! He never did any of that!”

        <h2 id="jokes">Playing the system</h2>
        <p>Two guys were out walking their dogs on a hot day when they pass by a bar. The first guy says, “Let’s get a beer."
        <p>The second guy says, “They won’t let us in with our dogs.”</p>
        <p>First guy: “Sure they will, just follow my lead.”</p>
        <p>He goes up to the pub, and sure enough, the bouncer says, “I can’t let you in here with that dog.”</p>
        <p>He replies, “Oh, I’m blind and this is my seeing-eye dog.”</p>
        <p>The bouncer says, “Ok then, come on in.”</p>
        <p>The second guy sees this and does the same thing. The bouncer says, “You can’t come in here with a dog.”</p>
        <p>He replies, “This is my seeing-eye dog because I'm blind'.”</p>
        <p>The bouncer responds, “You have a Chihuahua for a seeing-eye dog?”</p>
        <p>The second guy exclaims, “They gave me a Chihuahua?!”</p>
